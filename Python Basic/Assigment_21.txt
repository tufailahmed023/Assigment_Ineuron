import datetime
# Code to Add current date to the today.txt file
file = open('today.txt','w')
file.write(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%d-%m-%Y"))
file.close()
# Code to Read current date from today.txt file
file = open('today.txt','r')
print(file.read())
file.close()

2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string
file = open('today.txt','r')
today_string = file.read()
print(today_string)

3. Parse the date from today_string.
from datetime import datetime
parsed_data = datetime.strptime(today_string, '%d-%m-%Y')
print(parsed_data)

4. List the files in your current directory
import os
for folders, subfolders, files in os.walk(os.getcwd()):
    for file in files:
        print(file)


5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).
import os 
os.listdir()

6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.

7. Create a date object of your day of birth
from datetime import datetime
my_dob = datetime.strptime('02/07/2000','%d/%m/%Y')
print(my_dob, type(my_dob))

8. What day of the week was your day of birth?\
from datetime import datetime
my_dob = datetime(2000,7,02)
my_dob.strftime("%A")

9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
my_dob = datetime.strptime("02/07/2000",'%d/%m/%Y')
future_date = my_dob-timedelta(10000)
future_date
